Mr James Scott has a garage in Silbury and he has just bought a new garage in Pinhust ,
Pinhust is only five miles from Silbury ,but Mr Scotte cannot get a telephone for his new
garage ,so he has  just bought twelve pigeons.yesterday ,a pigeon carried the first message
from Pinhust to Silbury ,the bird carried the distance in three minutes ,up to now ,he has
sent a great many requests for spare parts and urgent messages from one garage to the other ,
in this way ,he has begun his own private telephone service ;
